So it looks to me that the degree was established for the 1996-1997 academic year under the name “piano accompanying” then changed the name to “collaborative piano” for the 2003-2004 year.

Griffiths	Y	griffikr@ucmail.uc.edu	MM in Collaborative Piano	From Ken Griffiths: As far as I know there is no historical connection of the CCM program with Mme Koldofsky. I know very little about Ruth Riley - only that she founded the program.  I did learn that there was very little in the way of classes offered in the initial years of the program. The few students who entered the program had one-on-one lessons/coachings with Ms Riley and that was about it. My immediate predecessor, Robert Evans, had no connection with Mme Koldofsky. I myself never pursued any academic program in collaborative piano. My various piano teachers always encouraged me to collaborate with other musicians, but it was only when I was studying the Lieder repertoire with Kammersänger Gerhard Hüsch in München that I seriously began to pursue this as a future career.  So, I guess you might say, that I am largely self-taught in the area of vocal collaboration. Of course, I learned a great deal by attending masterclasses with the likes of pianists such as Geoffrey Parsons, and, more recently, Graham Johnson, Hartmut Höll, and Julius Drake	Ruth Riley officially launched the program in 1972, although she had been lecturing in accompanying since 1968. Initially, the program offered limited coursework, with one-on-one lessons comprising most of the curriculum. In 1973-1974, Bonnie Bird succeeded Riley, followed by Miriam Kockritz (1974-1977), who served as Lecturer in Accompanying and Coaching. Kelly Hale became Assistant Professor of Opera and Accompanying (1977-1982), and Ken Griffiths has served as Assistant Professor of Accompanying and Director of Accompanying Activities since 1983.	https://ccm.uc.edu/areas-of-study/academic-units/piano/master-of-music-collaborative-piano.html

The piano graduate program was in place when I arrived at EMU in 1989. There were 3 tracks: solo piano, collaborative piano (called accompaniment, I believe), and pedagogy. I joined a full-time piano faculty made up of Joseph Gurt, Dady Mehta, and Anne Beth Gajda. All three of them are still alive and relatively healthy. I replaced Elaine Jacobson, who is deceased. There were also a few adjuncts. Joseph Gurt taught graduate piano accompaniment at that time, and I  remember him saying that he modeled the class on the classes he took at Juilliard in the 1950s.	Joseph Gurt joined the Eastern Michigan University (EMU) faculty in 1967 and established the accompanying program in 1968, which he directed until his retirement in 2000.	https://www.emich.edu/music-dance/music/programs/music-mm.php

I founded the program and designed the curriculum, at the request of the BSM dean, partially as a result of the difficulty we had in our attempt to hire a qualified vocal coach in previous years.  We found only two candidates who were both equipped for success in our advertised position and also interested in an entry-level position.  (We hired both of these, and one is still a beloved member of our faculty.) Our degree takes advantage of our unique situation, with a strong and internationally-known musical theater program housed within the School of Music (with B. Mus. And MMMT degrees offered), with voice and vocal coaching faculty teaching both vocal/opera performance and musical theater students.  So our MMVC students study to become proficient in both genres (even though most come to us with a desire to pursue either classical/opera or MT careers).  The size of our program provides a large amount of actual experience to our MMVC students, including musical direction and/or AMD positions, collaboration with singers in master classes and private lessons, etc.	Designed by Jan McDaniel, the program was initiated at the School of Music’s Dean’s request, partly to address challenges in hiring a qualified vocal coach.

Therefore there is no enrollment and hasn’t had enrollment for several years. I think it was in 2000 or 2001 that KU began a DMA in piano performance with a collaborative piano emphasis with Robert Koenig. That program is no longer, but is in the process of being reinstated (by me). This won’t happen for 2 years or so.	Robert Koenig was appointed as Professor of Piano Chamber Music at the University of Kansas in 2000 and was authorized to admit students interested in a Collaborative Piano track, although no distinct curriculum existed at that time. While a Master’s degree in Accompanying (vocal coaching) remains listed, there has been no vocal coach on faculty since 2022, and no student enrollment since at least 2020.

The first, called the “Ensemble Arts” degree, was led by Ellen Mack. According to the records I received, the first graduate of this program completed their studies in 1991, suggesting that Ellen started it in 1989. The last student Ellen accepted graduated in 2007, and during that time, only 17 majors graduated in 16 years. Ellen, of course,  was a student of Madame K, but I think she was more interested in teaching traditional piano performance—if she had wanted to build the program, I think she would have done so successfully, as she is a renowned and respected teacher. Due to the limited number of Ensemble Arts majors, the voice faculty encouraged me to start my own Vocal Accompanying program in 2006. My program was titled "Ensemble Arts: Vocal Accompanying," a name I wasn’t particularly fond of since I preferred something like “Collaborative Piano.” However, since Ellen’s program was still officially active, mine focused on Vocal Accompanying to avoid direct competition, although I always included instrumental pieces in my curriculum, believing it was essential. My program ran from 2006 until 2019, when it was placed on “hiatus” by the administration for various political and funding reasons that I can explain further in a phone call if you’d like. My last student graduated in 2021. Over the course of 15 years, I had about 30 majors, many of whom are now working across the United States, Europe, and Asia.  I was also serving as Peabody Opera’s Principal Coach during this time, which limited my ability to take on more students due to time constraints and insufficient scholarship support.	The Peabody Institute previously offered two distinct Collaborative Piano programs, both of which are no longer active. The first, an Ensemble Arts degree, was founded and directed by Ellen Mack, with its first graduate completing studies in 1991, suggesting an inception around 1989. Mack graduated 17 majors over 16 years, with the final student completing in 2007. Due to limited enrollment, the voice faculty encouraged Eileen Cornett to establish a separate Vocal Accompanying program, titled Ensemble Arts: Vocal Accompanying, in 2006. This second program operated until 2019, when it lost its funding, graduating its last student in 2021 and producing around 30 majors over 15 years.

Penna: "Glenn Parker joined the faculty at WCC in 1981, and, after Martin Katz left, he continued the Accompanying/Coaching curriculum inaugurated in 1976. I believe a woman named Helen Yorke was involved in the teaching of pianists there in the mid-1990s (maybe 1994-96), as Glenn was devoting more time to the opera program and to other classwork. I joined the faculty in 1996, shortly after Glenn's passing. Although my initial appointment was in the Piano Department, the bulk of my work (90%) was with singers, both in the studio and in the classroom. During my tenure, there was less and less of a Piano Department presence/culture and fewer resources for recruitment, even as many, many extraordinary singers passed through the school. I was eventually reassigned to the Voice department as overall piano enrollment declined in the late 2000s. I left in 2019, and the Accompanying and Coaching program was officially phased out in 2020 (or 2021). Once the Princeton campus closed and the few remaining faculty and voice students were relocated to the Lawrenceville campus, everything was downsized. My position was not filled, although Susan Ashbaker was brought in full time to wear a number of hats in opera, coaching, classes, etc. (She may still work with the occasional pianist, but there is no formal program.) Finally, of course, Dalton Baldwin had a long association with the school going back to the 1960s. He was officially a guest faculty, coming to campus 4-8 times a year to see singers and pianists until his retirement in the 2010s.	Dalton Baldwin’s long association with the school began in the 1960s, serving as guest faculty until his retirement in the 2010s. In 1976, Martin Katz was invited to launch the degree program, which continued under Glenn Parker after Katz’s departure. Helen Yorke taught pianists in the mid-1990s as Parker expanded his role in opera. J.J. Penna joined in 1996, initially in the Piano Department but primarily teaching singers, and later transitioned to the Voice Department as piano enrollment declined. Following Penna’s departure in 2019, the Accompanying and Coaching program was phased out in 2020-2021 as the school consolidated to the Lawrenceville campus. Susan Ashbaker subsequently joined to oversee opera and coaching needs but the program was not reinstated
DONE	Curtis Institute of Music	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania	0.8552966798159106;0.3616813294232649	1932- ended in 1994 when Sokoloff retired)		1934	1994	Harry Kaufmann	Other	pink	Sokoloff retired and the program ended.			Bachelors in Accompanying; Undergraduate Diploma in Accompanying	According to the Curtis Achivists:  Our course books state that the Accompanying program began in 1929 and was headed by Harry Kaufmann. The school was not granted the ability to confer degrees to students until 1934, after which students who had met all requirements for a degree were awarded retroactively. Because of the earlier questions, I pulled out our commencement programs which show that 2 students received a Bachelor of Music in Accompanying and 1 student earned the degree in Violin and Accompanying in 1934. Without requesting those student records from the registrar, I would not be able to determine which if any students in any commencement received their degrees retroactively. Student records are closed for research unless requested by a direct family member. If you have any additional questions I will be happy to see what I can do for you. According to Audrey Axinn: The 'accompanying' program at Curtis wasn't uncredited; they weren't accredited to offer any Masters program in the late 80s but they did offer accompanying as a major as a Bachelors or Undergraduate Diploma. I already had a Bachelors degree in solo piano from Manhattan School of Music and I spent the majority of my time in that 4-year solo piano program playing collaboratively with many of the violinists and cellists at MSM. My jump into a collaborative program was going to Curtis after graduating from MSM in the diploma program that was a two-year program that had no liberal arts or music history requirement and gave placement tests for theory, ear training and keyboard skills. It included required language and diction courses in German and Italian and English diction. I believe they also required French language and diction but I placed out. There were no classes in song repertoire. Vladimir Sokoloff who used to play regularly with Efrem ZImbalist was the only faculty member and he did not have any experience working with singers. In my day, Curtis hired staff coaches/pianists to play with singers and I think it is the same today. It wasn't a very comprehensive curriculum but there were very ample opportunities to do studio playing and perform with very talented colleagues. Since it wasn't a Masters degree, it was clear to me that I needed to move on to another school after two years (they offered the option of sticking around for a third year and just playing full-time). Curtis eliminated accompanying as a major certainly by the time Mr. Sokoloff died in 1997- but possibly earlier as I imagine he wasn't teaching right up to his passing. I don't recall which year the program disappeared. A classmate of mine who was a solo pianist named Hugh Sung, took over as a sort of coordinator of accompanying at the school. He played with any faculty or guest artists giving recitals and my understanding is the solo pianists were assigned to play with their colleagues. I don't know if Curtis requires current solo piano majors to do any collaborative work aside from playing in chamber music groups and to what extent they employ staff pianists' today. If it would be helpful I can ask some Juilliard pianists who attended Curtis recently if they can shed some light on how this is being organized nowadays.	The now-defunct accompanying program at the Curtis Institute of Music is believed to be the oldest of its kind in the United States. Established in 1929 under the leadership of Harry Kaufmann, it began awarding degrees in 1934 following authorization to do so. Kaufmann directed the program for 17 years, after which it is believed that Vladimir Sokoloff assumed leadership, though this has not been confirmed. Sokoloff led the program until his retirement in 1994.

About the Collaborative Piano Program History Visualization

This data visualization, published in connection with the hybrid monograph & digital publication Accompaniment in America: Contextualizing Collaborative Piano (2025, Routledge) traces the history and evolution of collaborative piano programs across North America, contextualizing the development of this discipline in academic settings. With a timeline from the 1930s to 2025, it offers users a dynamic, interactive map where degree-giving programs are marked according to founding date, current status, and notable affiliations. Dots appear as the user scrolls along the timeline, indicating each program’s location, status, and legacy as they emerge. Programs that have or have had a strong connection to the Gwendolyn Koldofsky legacy are colored blue/purple, all other existing programs are orange. Now defunct programs are pink, while programs for which little to no information about their origins is known are turquoise.
Designed by Chanda VanderHart and programmed by David Wögerbauer, this visualization offers a layered, narrative-driven exploration of collaborative piano education. Users can delve deeper into each program’s history by selecting individual points on the map, which reveal details about the program’s founder, year of establishment, and current leadership. Programs that have lost funding or ceased operation appear in pink, underscoring changes in the field over time.
The data, gathered by Lauren Koszyk and Chanda VanderHart with help from Elvia Puccinelli, Jean Barr, and Kathleen Kelly, reflects contributions from faculty members, administrators, and archivists. As knowledge of the field continues to evolve, users are encouraged to contribute updates or corrections to ensure ongoing accuracy. This project is designed to reflect the collaborative spirit of the discipline and to offer a rich resource for understanding its historical and pedagogical landscape.
