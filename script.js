The earliest graduate school catalog I’ve found that mentions “collaborative piano” as a major is from 2003-2004 (here: https://digitalcollections-baylor.quartexcollections.com/Documents/Detail/the-graduate-school-2003-2004/2355145?item=2355273).

So it looks to me that the degree was established for the 1996-1997 academic year under the name “piano accompanying” then changed the name to “collaborative piano” for the 2003-2004 year. Does that seem right to you? I can’t seem to find any sort of press release about the creation of the degree, oddly.

Griffiths	Y	griffikr@ucmail.uc.edu	MM in Collaborative Piano	From Ken Griffiths: As far as I know there is no historical connection of the CCM program with Mme Koldofsky. I know very little about Ruth Riley - only that she founded the program.  I did learn that there was very little in the way of classes offered in the initial years of the program. The few students who entered the program had one-on-one lessons/coachings with Ms Riley and that was about it. My immediate predecessor, Robert Evans, had no connection with Mme Koldofsky. I myself never pursued any academic program in collaborative piano. My various piano teachers always encouraged me to collaborate with other musicians, but it was only when I was studying the Lieder repertoire with Kammersänger Gerhard Hüsch in München that I seriously began to pursue this as a future career.  So, I guess you might say, that I am largely self-taught in the area of vocal collaboration. Of course, I learned a great deal by attending masterclasses with the likes of pianists such as Geoffrey Parsons, and, more recently, Graham Johnson, Hartmut Höll, and Julius Drake	Ruth Riley launched the program officially in 1972 but had been lecturing in accompanying since 1968, although there was very little in the way of classes offered in the initial years of the program. The few students who entered the program had one-on-one lessons/coachings with Riley and that was the extent of things.

I founded the program and designed the curriculum, at the request of the BSM dean, partially as a result of the difficulty we had in our attempt to hire a qualified vocal coach in previous years.  We found only two candidates who were both equipped for success in our advertised position and also interested in an entry-level position.  (We hired both of these, and one is still a beloved member of our faculty.) Our degree takes advantage of our unique situation, with a strong and internationally-known musical theater program housed within the School of Music (with B. Mus. And MMMT degrees offered), with voice and vocal coaching faculty teaching both vocal/opera performance and musical theater students.  So our MMVC students study to become proficient in both genres (even though most come to us with a desire to pursue either classical/opera or MT careers).  The size of our program provides a large amount of actual experience to our MMVC students, including musical direction and/or AMD positions, collaboration with singers in master classes and private lessons, etc.	Founded and designed by Jan McDaniel, the program was initiated at the request of the Dean at the School of Music, in part in response to past difficulty hiring a qualified vocal coach. The Master of Music in Vocal Coaching accepted its first student in the fall of 2009, and the first graduates completed degree requirements in the spring of 2011.  	https://www.okcu.edu/programs/master-of-music-in-vocal-coaching

I was one of very first collaborative pianists at Texas Tech University to make a shift (through proper full-size new job search) from staff to a faculty position - Assistant Professor of Practice – commenced in Jan 2019.  My personal task was to establish Collaborative Piano Program, so I suppose I have ‘founded’ it. First, I put together a Grad Certificate in Collab Piano in Fall 2019 (has been successful ever since then).

Yet only in Spring 2023 we had accepted our first student in that degree, 2nd applicant should be starting Spring 25.

The last student Ellen accepted graduated in 2007, and during that time, only 17 majors graduated in 16 years. Ellen, of course,  was a student of Madame K, but I think she was more interested in teaching traditional piano performance—if she had wanted to build the program, I think she would have done so successfully, as she is a renowned and respected teacher. Due to the limited number of Ensemble Arts majors, the voice faculty encouraged me to start my own Vocal Accompanying program in 2006. My program was titled "Ensemble Arts: Vocal Accompanying," a name I wasn’t particularly fond of since I preferred something like “Collaborative Piano.” However, since Ellen’s program was still officially active, mine focused on Vocal Accompanying to avoid direct competition, although I always included instrumental pieces in my curriculum, believing it was essential. My program ran from 2006 until 2019, when it was placed on “hiatus” by the administration for various political and funding reasons that I can explain further in a phone call if you’d like. My last student graduated in 2021. Over the course of 15 years, I had about 30 majors, many of whom are now working across the United States, Europe, and Asia.  I was also serving as Peabody Opera’s Principal Coach during this time, which limited my ability to take on more students due to time constraints and insufficient scholarship support.

I believe a woman named Helen Yorke was involved in the teaching of pianists there in the mid-1990s (maybe 1994-96), as Glenn was devoting more time to the opera program and to other classwork. I joined the faculty in 1996, shortly after Glenn's passing. Although my initial appointment was in the Piano Department, the bulk of my work (90%) was with singers, both in the studio and in the classroom. During my tenure, there was less and less of a Piano Department presence/culture and fewer resources for recruitment, even as many, many extraordinary singers passed through the school. I was eventually reassigned to the Voice department as overall piano enrollment declined in the late 2000s. I left in 2019, and the Accompanying and Coaching program was officially phased out in 2020 (or 2021). Once the Princeton campus closed and the few remaining faculty and voice students were relocated to the Lawrenceville campus, everything was downsized. My position was not filled, although Susan Ashbaker was brought in full time to wear a number of hats in opera, coaching, classes, etc. (She may still work with the occasional pianist, but there is no formal program.)

In 1976 Martin Katz was approached to begin the degree-giving program, which he did until leaving for the University of Michigan. Glenn Parker joined the faculty at WCC in 1981, and Katz’ departure continued the Accompanying/Coaching curriculum. Helen Yorke was involved in the teaching of pianists there in the mid-1990s (maybe 1994-96), as Glenn was devoting more time to the opera program and to other responsibilities. J.J. Penna joined the faculty in 1996, shortly after Glenn's passing, and although his initial appointment was in the Piano Department, 90% of it was with singers, both in the studio and in the classroom. Declines in piano enrollment in the late 2000s led to his reassignment to the voice department. Penna left in 2019, and the Accompanying and Coaching program was officially phased out in 2020/2021). Once the Princeton campus closed and the few remaining faculty and voice students were relocated to the Lawrenceville campus, everything was downsized. Penna’s position was not filled, although Susan Ashbaker was brought in full time to wear a number of hats in opera, coaching, classes, etc. There is no longer a formal program.
DONE	Curtis Institute of Music	Pennsylvania	0.8552966798159106;0.3616813294232649	1932- ended in 1994 when Sokoloff retired)		1932	1994	Harry Kaufmann	Other	faded standard	Sokoloff retired and the program ended.			Bachelors in Accompanying; Undergraduate Diploma in Accompanying	According to the Curtis Achivists:  Our course books state that the Accompanying program began in 1929 and was headed by Harry Kaufmann. The school was not granted the ability to confer degrees to students until 1934, after which students who had met all requirements for a degree were awarded retroactively. Because of the earlier questions, I pulled out our commencement programs which show that 2 students received a Bachelor of Music in Accompanying and 1 student earned the degree in Violin and Accompanying in 1934. Without requesting those student records from the registrar, I would not be able to determine which if any students in any commencement received their degrees retroactively. Student records are closed for research unless requested by a direct family member. If you have any additional questions I will be happy to see what I can do for you. According to Audrey Axinn: The 'accompanying' program at Curtis wasn't uncredited; they weren't accredited to offer any Masters program in the late 80s but they did offer accompanying as a major as a Bachelors or Undergraduate Diploma. I already had a Bachelors degree in solo piano from Manhattan School of Music and I spent the majority of my time in that 4-year solo piano program playing collaboratively with many of the violinists and cellists at MSM. My jump into a collaborative program was going to Curtis after graduating from MSM in the diploma program that was a two-year program that had no liberal arts or music history requirement and gave placement tests for theory, ear training and keyboard skills. It included required language and diction courses in German and Italian and English diction. I believe they also required French language and diction but I placed out. There were no classes in song repertoire. Vladimir Sokoloff who used to play regularly with Efrem ZImbalist was the only faculty member and he did not have any experience working with singers. In my day, Curtis hired staff coaches/pianists to play with singers and I think it is the same today. It wasn't a very comprehensive curriculum but there were very ample opportunities to do studio playing and perform with very talented colleagues. Since it wasn't a Masters degree, it was clear to me that I needed to move on to another school after two years (they offered the option of sticking around for a third year and just playing full-time). Curtis eliminated accompanying as a major certainly by the time Mr. Sokoloff died in 1997- but possibly earlier as I imagine he wasn't teaching right up to his passing. I don't recall which year the program disappeared. A classmate of mine who was a solo pianist named Hugh Sung, took over as a sort of coordinator of accompanying at the school. He played with any faculty or guest artists giving recitals and my understanding is the solo pianists were assigned to play with their colleagues. I don't know if Curtis requires current solo piano majors to do any collaborative work aside from playing in chamber music groups and to what extent they employ staff pianists' today. If it would be helpful I can ask some Juilliard pianists who attended Curtis recently if they can shed some light on how this is being organized nowadays.	The now-defunct Accompanying program at Curtis is the oldest in the US as far as we can determine. It began in 1929 and was headed by Harry Kaufmann, but did not give out degrees until 1934, when it was authorized to officially offer them. Kaufmann ran the program for 17 years, at which point it is likely that Sokoloff took it over, although that has not been verified. Sokoloff then headed the program / class -- as it was -- until his retirement in 1994.
