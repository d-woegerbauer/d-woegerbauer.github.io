          This data visualization, published in connection with the fourth
          chapter of Accompaniment in America: Contextualizing Collaborative
          Piano (2025, Routledge) traces the history and evolution of
          collaborative piano programs across North America, contextualizing the
          development of this discipline in academic settings. With a timeline
          spanning from the 1930s to 2025, it offers users a dynamic,
          interactive map where degree-giving programs are marked according to
          founding date, current status, and notable affiliations. Dots appear
          as the user scrolls along the timeline, indicating each program’s
          location and legacy as they emerge. Programs connected to Gwendolyn
          Koldofsky—the pioneering figure of collaborative piano pedagogy—are
          colored in Bordeaux to signify her legacy.
          <br /><br />
          Designed by Chanda VanderHart and programmed by David Wögerbauer, this
          visualization offers a layered, narrative-driven exploration of
          collaborative piano education. Users can delve deeper into each
          program’s history by selecting individual points on the map, which
          reveal details about the program’s founder, year of establishment, and
          current leadership. Programs that have lost funding or ceased
          operation appear as faded markers, underscoring changes in the field
          over time.
          <br />

          The data, gathered by Lauren Koszyk and Chanda VanderHart with the
          assistance of Elvia Puccinelli, Jean Barr, and Kathleen Kelly,
          reflects contributions from faculty members, administrators, and
          archivists. As the field and knowledge about it continues to evolve,
          users are encouraged to contribute updates or corrections to ensure
          ongoing accuracy. This project stands as a testament to the
          collaborative spirit inherent in the discipline and offers a rich
          resource for understanding its historical and pedagogical landscape.
