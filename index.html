        <h1>Visualization of University Programs</h1>
        <p>
          This data visualization, published in connection with the hybrid
          monograph & digital publication Accompaniment in America:
          Contextualizing Collaborative Piano (2025, Routledge) traces the
          history and evolution of collaborative piano programs across North
          America, contextualizing the development of this discipline in
          academic settings. With a timeline from the 1930s to 2025, it offers
          users a dynamic, interactive map where degree-giving programs are
          marked according to founding date, current status, and notable
          affiliations. Dots appear as the user scrolls along the timeline,
          indicating each program’s location, status, and legacy as they emerge.
          Programs that have or have had a strong connection to the Gwendolyn
          Koldofsky legacy are colored blue/purple, all other existing programs
          are orange. Now defunct programs are pink, while programs for which
          little to no information about their origins is known are turquoise.
          <br /><br />
          Designed by Chanda VanderHart and programmed by David Wögerbauer, this
          visualization offers a layered, narrative-driven exploration of
          collaborative piano education. Users can delve deeper into each
          program’s history by selecting individual points on the map, which
          reveal details about the program’s founder, year of establishment, and
          current leadership. Programs that have lost funding or ceased
          operation appear in pink, underscoring changes in the field over time.
          <br />
          <br />
          The data, gathered by Lauren Koszyk and Chanda VanderHart with help
          from Elvia Puccinelli, Jean Barr, and Kathleen Kelly, reflects
          contributions from faculty members, administrators, and archivists. As
          knowledge of the field continues to evolve, users are encouraged to
          contribute updates or corrections to ensure ongoing accuracy. This
          project is designed to reflect the collaborative spirit of the
          discipline and to offer a rich resource for understanding its
          historical and pedagogical landscape.
